# Overview

This is my first Android App, which is a Wordle-like game that includes the 1000 most common English words of all lengths. I made this to learn how to program for Android using Android Studio. The goal is to have a game to connect with friends and send each other words. 

Currently it functions like the game Wordle. You are given a number of letters and you guess words.
* Green = Correct letter in the correct spot
* Red = Correct letter in the incorrect spot
* Dark Blue = Incorrect letter

# Future Work

* Error check for not enough letters entered
* User only enters on one line at a time
* Cannot delete finished words
* Implement network to send words to friends
